# What Is Transfer Learning?
Transfer learning is one of the handiest tools to use if youâ€™re working on any sort of image classification problem. But what exactly is it? How can you implement it? How accurate is it? This will go in-depth into transfer learning and show you how to apply it using the Keras library.

Note that a prerequisite to learning transfer learning is to have basic knowledge of convolutional neural networks (CNN) since image classification calls for using this algorithm.

CNNs make use of convolution layers that utilize filters to help recognize the important features in an image. These features, of which there are many, help distinguish a particular image. Whenever you train a CNN on a bunch of images, all these features are learned internally. In addition, when you use a deep CNN, the number of parameters that are being learned - also called weights - can be in the millions. Therefore, when numerous parameters need to be learned, it takes time. And this is where transfer learning helps.
